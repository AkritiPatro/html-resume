<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there, I am Akriti, I don't have much to say about myself, but still let me say few things about me, so you
   would know who actually I am.</p>

<p>Lets start with my hobbies, well, I love to read fiction novels in my free time, especially dark romance(hehe,a little secret about me, so sshh),
  and in sports, I have a quite a few, but the thing it has been a long time, since I have played them, so I don't know if I am still good in them or not,
  but here a few like, volleyball, badminton, basketball and swimming and ofc my fav hobby is to just scroll insta and watch movies, series of diff lang or regions
  on the internet.</p>

<p>And last, I would say that, I am an ambivert, who was on the more of extrovert side and now more on the introvert side,
   so yeah, thats about it, I would talk more about myself later, when I would feel like, but for now, only this much I have
   to talk about.</p>

<p>Feel free to contact me through my email prferably(I don't pick up unknown numbers), to share your thoughts and feelings about anything you feel like sharing,
   I would love to suppport and guide you.</p>
